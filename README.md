# DrumMachine
Musical soundboard.
Project focuses on DOM manipulation and Javascript to create a drum set sound board that responds to events. Changed the order of the instruments to better fit the layout of a drum set in a DAW workspace and to put the kick, snare, and crash cymbal together for easier playing for the user.
