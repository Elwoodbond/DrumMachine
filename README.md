Musical soundboard. DOM manipulation and Advanced JavaScript practice from Angela Yu's Complete Fullstack Course.
Sound Board project with personal edits created with guided practice from The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu.  Project focuses on DOM manipulation and Advanced Javascript to create a drum set sound board that responds to events. Changed the order of the instruments to better fit the layout of a drum set in a DAW workspace and to put the kick, snare, and crash cymbal together for easier playing for the user.
